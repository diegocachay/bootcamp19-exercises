The list items will be objects that contain a unique id, the actual to do. There will also be a subcomponent inside the list items for the delete button which functions by deleting the object from the location in which it is stored. For now we are planning on storing the objects in an array, so that we can easily access the todo's based on their index, which will also become their unique id, and delete them.

The second main component will be 2 input text bars and add button component. one bars will be a search bar that will be able to search through the todos and filter through them using the substring feature. The second bar will simply add todo's to the array with a unique id, the todo (a string) and
